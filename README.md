# X-Road REST Standards and Guidelines

## Introduction

The purpose of these documents is to describe the best practices of integrating REST services between organizations using X-Road. 

This documentation consists of two main documents. The standards document describes the technical means and method to implement a REST API. The guideline document describes how to successfully design a REST API.

This documentation is intended for architects and programmers, who will use REST as an integration method, and utilize X-Road as a distributed data exchange layer.
